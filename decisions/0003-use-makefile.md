# 3. use-makefile

Date: 2023-06-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The bin scripts are very useful, but I feel some scripts are less readable.
Also, there were times when I couldn't do detailed operations.

## Decision

Using the Makefile as a solution separated some functions and made them more flexible.

## Consequences

Configuration management is easier.
Improved the readability of some configuration management scripts.
